## 🚀 Quick Start (Dockerized)

### ✅ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

---

### 🔨 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kavindaktk2025/my-scrap-project.git
cd my-scrap-project
````

---

### 🐳 Run Using Docker (One-Time Crawl)

1. **Build Docker Image:**

```bash
docker build -t my-scrap-project .
```

2. **Run the Spider:**

```bash
docker run --rm my-scrap-project scrapy crawl ikmanlistings
```

This will run the `ikmanlistings` spider and output the scraped data to your console.

---

### 🧪 Run with Docker Compose (Preferred for Dev)

1. **Build and Start the Services:**

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

2. **Run the Spider Inside the Container:**

```bash
docker-compose exec scrapy scrapy crawl ikmanlistings
```

3. **Stop the Containers:**

```bash
docker-compose down
```

---

## 📄 Output

Scraped data can be exported to formats like JSON or CSV using Scrapy's built-in options:

```bash
scrapy crawl ikmanlistings -o output.json
```

> When using Docker, prepend this command with `docker run` or use `docker-compose exec` as shown above.
